## Introduction

MeiliSearch is an open-source, fast, and highly relevant search engine that allows you to integrate powerful search capabilities into your applications with ease. This guide provides simple examples on how to connect to MeiliSearch, load data, and perform searches using different programming languages.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure that you have MeiliSearch installed and running. 

You can simple build and run the [Dockerfile](Meilisearch-Docker/Dockerfile), which is the easiest way to get started.

```bash
docker build -t meilisearch-image .
docker run -it -p 7700:7700 --name meilisearch-container meilisearch-image
```

You can also follow the official [MeiliSearch installation guide](https://docs.meilisearch.com/guides/advanced_guides/installation.html) for detailed instructions.

Next, you'll need to set up your MeiliSearch client for your chosen programming language. Refer to the examples in this guide for language-specific client setup instructions.

Each example includes:

- Connecting to your MeiliSearch instance.
- Loading data into an index.
- Performing a search operation.

You can copy and adapt these examples to integrate MeiliSearch into your projects using your preferred programming language.
